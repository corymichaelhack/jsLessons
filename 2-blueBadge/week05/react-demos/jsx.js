/*
    ! Students do not need to follow along - put started on Github
    * Just code and show some basic JSX concepts 
    * Create a basic react app and tear out boiler plate
*/

 // * Write just regular JSX tags like div, p, or h2's
    // ! Explain JSX as React's way of handling markup code
    // ? What kind of markup code have we been using before?  -- Html


// * add an onClick handler for extra exposure on attribute casing
    // ! Handler doesn't need to do anything special, a console.log() is fine

 // * Add a className attribute to a tag and styling with with the App.css file   
    // ! in JSX all attribute names are camelCased 

    
    // * Make some input tags and show how the type attribute still works as normal
    // ! Reiterate that attribute DATA values use {}'s, and STRING attribute values use "".
    
    // * Create some values in state and display them on the page

// * Create a style prop in the App.js and use the style attribute so show off CSS in JS

// * Create some values above the return in the render and show those values in JSX w/o having to use this

// * Use a ternary to demonstrate conditional rendering w/ return

// ! Push finished code to github and share link to repo
