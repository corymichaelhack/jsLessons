                    <h2>What are Class Components?</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Class Components are our very own React components. They are created using JavaScript's class system and keyword, and are capable of tracking local information, and typically define logic functions to use locally, or pass off to child components.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>What is 'local'?</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>When we use 'locally', we are referring to within a certain component, or locale. When it comes to class components, their locale is themselves. They can also pass their information and logic along to other components or locales as well.</p>

                <!-- lets look at an example -->
                <section>
                    <pre><code>
class SignUp extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = {
            title : 'Hello React'
        }
    }

    render() {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        )
    }
}
                    </code></pre>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Extends & React Component</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <pre><code>
            class SignUp extends React.Component {
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Whenever we create a new class component, we create it based off of the React Component that is provided to us via React itself. Creating our component with the React Component as it's blueprint has many advantages, namely the LifeCycle methods our components will inherit.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Life Cycle Methods</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Life Cycle Methods, sometimes called Life Cycle Hooks, are methods defined by the parent React component. The compiler for our app will actually call these methods at different points in the component's life cycle. If we implement these methods, we can get different kinds of control over our components.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Constructors</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <pre><code>
            constructor() {
                super();
                this.state = {
                    title : 'Hello React'
                }
            }
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Constructors are a part of classes in any programming language. The constructor, as it's name implies, has the responsibility of setting up the class, and constructing any values that should be present at the creation of the class.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Super</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <pre><code>
                            super();
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>When we inherit from another class, often times we need to make sure the properties and methods the parent defines are set. If we don't plan on changing how our custom class is set up, we can let JavaScript call the parent's constructor, and move on. If we want to change it however, we'll need to use <code>super()</code> to call the parent's constructor, <em>before</em> we start defining custom changes to our classes.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Render</h2> 
                    <hr />
                    <pre><code>
                render() {
                    return (
                        &lt;div&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                    )
                }
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>The <code>render()</code> method is the <em>only</em> method a stateful component has to implement. It's also a life cycle method! The <code>render()</code> method takes care of displaying our markup code to the page, just make sure you return it.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                        <h2>What is 'this'?</h2>
                        <hr />
                        <p>The keyword <code>this</code> is used to refer to contexts. <code>this</code> always refers to <em>it's own</em> context. So inside class components, <code>this</code> usually refers to the component itself.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Using Props</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <pre><code>
        &lt;button onClick={this.props.onClick}&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>The practice of using <code>props</code> in class component is a bit different than functional components. Since we are inside a class, we must refer to the context where our props reside, again usually the component itself.</p>

            <section> <!-- STATE -->
                <section>
                    <h1>State</h1>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Whats state?</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>At it's most basic. State is a property of our class components. It is an object made of different key-value pairs of data that our application needs to keep track of.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <pre><code>
                constructor() {
                    super();
                    this.state = {
                        username : '',
                        password: ''
                    }
                }
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Heres an example of what a log in component's state could be. A user would need to enter a username and password to log into a website. This component's state is set up to track both as strings.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Using State</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <pre><code>
                    &lt;h2&gt;{ this.state.title }&lt;/h2&gt;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>There's no point in setting up a data store if you can't access anything in it. Since <code>state</code> is a property of our class components, and <code>this</code> gives us access to our current context, usually the class itself, we can easily access different values inside the state object.</p>
