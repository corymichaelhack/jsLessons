                    <h2>What is JSX?</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>JSX is a syntactic extension for JavaScript. It is used by many React developers for their markup code. Markup code is simply the code that generates what we see on a website. HTML is markup code we've already been using.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>JSX vs. HTML</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <pre><code>
            const title = &lt;h2&gt;Hello React!&lt;/h2&gt;;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>JSX looks very close to HTML, but it is really still JavaScript. Under the hood, React is reading our JSX, compiling it into a function call, and building out HTML elements for us. So we're free to write JSX without having to worry about how it'll be read by the browser.</p>

                    <h2>Embedding Data</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <pre><code>
            const appTitle = 'EFA Chat';
            const title = &lt;h2&gt;{ appTitle }&lt;/h2&gt;;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>React and JSX also give us an easy way to embed regular JavaScript expressions. React will attempt to parse anything between two curly braces as a JavaScript expression, and output the result in the place of the curly braces.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>JSX as an Expression</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <pre><code>
            if(loggedIn) {
                return &lt;h2&gt;Welcome back { username }&lt;/h2&gt;;
            } else {
                return &lt;h2&gt;Please log in&lt;/h2&gt;;
            };
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Since JSX is an expression, you can use it inside of if statements, and for loops, or even return it from functions.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Attributes with JSX</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Like HTML elements, tags used in JSX can accept attributes, but there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Attribute Values</h2>
                    <hr />
                <pre><code>
            const avatar = &lt;img src={ imgPath }&gt;&lt;/img&gt;;
            const img = &lt;img src="https://www.google.com"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;;
                </code></pre>
                <p>Instead of wrapping our data values for attributes with quotes as we'd do in HTML, we wrap expression values with curly braces, but non-data values can still use quotes.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                        <h2>Attribute Names</h2>
                        <hr />
            <pre><code>
            &lt;button onClick={this.handleSubmit}&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
            </code></pre>
                    <p>We must also be aware that instead of leaving attribute names all undercase, when writing JSX we camel case them.</p>

                    <h2>What is C.R.A?</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Create-react-app is the name of a very handy package created by Facebook. It's intent is to get you up and running with React as quickly as possible.</p>

                    <h2>Why use C.R.A?</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Create React App is what is known as a build workflow tool. It creates and initializes a basic React application, configures out settings, and sets up a development server with live reload. Not all of these are standard React features. So we're very lucky Facebook made and released this tool.</p>
