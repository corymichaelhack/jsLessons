                    <hr />
                    <p>React is a JavaScript library created and maintained by the developers of Facebook. It is
                        currently
                        the most popular JavaScript library for dynamic front end applications written in JavaScript.
                        It
                        has a rich ecosystem of packages to add to React's capabilities.</p>

                    <hr />
                    <p>You will very often hear React referred to as a library. A JavaScript library is tool we can use
                        to enhance our JavaScript. You will also likely hear the word framework. Frameworks are more of
                        a set of tools and practices that dictate how an application is built.</p>

                    <h2>Dynamic Web Applications</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>React has many benefits in terms of front end development. For instance, React gives us the
                        ability
                        to dynamically change the layout or content of our web applications without refreshing the
                        entire
                        page. Instead we can change and update only what needs to be updated. </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>ES6 Support</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Since React is compiled by babel <em>into</em> ES5, we are free to write ES6 in our React code.
                        Meaning we get methods like .map(), .filter() and .reduce(), as well as many syntactic
                        improvements from ES5, which are not all supposed by most modern browsers.</p>

                    <h2>Components</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>All React apps are made up of components. These components handle various small chunks of logic
                        and display different information. React uses JavaScript's class system to give us a
                        base React component that we can use as a launch pad for our own components.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>LifeCycle Hooks</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>The base React Component comes with various hooks or methods that are invoked in different times during our components' lives. Using them in our own components lets us customize what our components will do in those moments.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Application State Management</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Another feature provided by React is the ability to efficiently control the state of your React
                        components, the building blocks of your application. You can think of the state as a data store
                        for information the application needs to function. Like if a user is logged in or not.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>One-Way Data Binding</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Out of the box, React allows for components to pass both data, and methods to their child
                        components. Those values and methods can then be used by the child, or even passed on further
                        to it's children.</p>

                    <h2>The React Component</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>All React apps are made of components, and there are two main types of components, Class
                        components, and Functional components.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Class Components</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Class components are also known as 'smart' components. These components are built off of the
                        React component, and get to take advantage of different features that are built into the React
                        Component, life LifeCycle Hooks. These components are known as 'smart' because they also usually contain and manage
                        their own state. </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Functional Components</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>These components are not built off of the React Component, and instead are built out by the
                        developer as a function. Functional components are often called 'display' components, because they handle
                        receiving information, and displaying some kind of result.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Passing Data Between Components</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Because of JavaScript's class system, any value or method of that class is considered a property of that class. AS such, any component that passes a value or method to it's child is said to be passing a 'property' or 'prop'.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Properties/Props</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Props can be any value, or method. They could even be a value or method originating from their parent's parent. These properties are appended to child components through a special <code>props</code> object</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>The Path to the Browser</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>All components, in one way or another, get funneled into the App Component. Which is
                        bootstrapped to the index.html of our project.</p>
                    <p>Remember: The index.html is the file that our browser cares about. React will end up being
                        rendered here through the index.html by our React code.</p>
