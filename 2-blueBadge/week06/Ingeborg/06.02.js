/* 
    REACT CHALLENGE DAY TWO
    TOPICS HIT:: FETCH() MAP() AND STYLE PROPS

    Bronze--
    
    The the DayTwo component the ability to use a .fetch() to reach out to the studio ghibli api and return information about people.  Store that information in a 'people' state value, and print it to the console. This should all take place in a call to useEffect OR a callback passed to useEffect().

    Add an <h2></h2> and use a style prop to style the <h2></h2>.

    Note that styling and grabbing api data function independently!

    use this url for accessing the ghibli api:
    https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/people/

    Silver-- 
    Create a functional component called Display
    Use .map() to call your Display component multiple times, 
    with each Display responsible for showing the name from a peron to the webpage.
    Use a styling prop to style Display's appearance

    Gold--
    Have your Display Functional Component passed a second prop, this time for the person's gender.
    Add a button inside the functional component that will toggle between name and gender
    to be displayed.

// * Blue Badge Project Planning Meeting Two

/*
  * Iron out :: 
    - CRUD tables - what data is needed, how do they related to users? Any foreseeable problems?

    - Third Party APIs - have we investigated them? To they use CORS? How do we interact with this API?

    - Key features & Functionality - Make sure we're getting full CRUD

    - Stretch Goals - Things to save until the end, or ways for students to push themselves?
    
    - Foreseeable Challenges - Anything they need to knock out right away? Do they want/have the capability to to work with images?

  ! For next Planning Meeting
    - Consider different end points needed to get core functionality
    - CRUD & User table column names & types
    - What views will the client have? 
    - How does the App flow when being used?
    - 
    
    - If they want images, how do they want to do it ( saving URLS or multer )
