// * Blue Badge Project Planning Meeting Two

/*
  * Iron out :: 
    - CRUD tables - what data is needed, how do they related to users? Any foreseeable problems?

    - Third Party APIs - have we investigated them? To they use CORS? How do we interact with this API?

    - Key features & Functionality - Make sure we're getting full CRUD

    - Stretch Goals - Things to save until the end, or ways for students to push themselves?
    
    - Foreseeable Challenges - Anything they need to knock out right away? Do they want/have the capability to to work with images?

  ! For next Planning Meeting
    - Consider different end points needed to get core functionality
    - CRUD & User table column names & types
    - What views will the client have? 
    - How does the App flow when being used?
    - 
    
    - If they want images, how do they want to do it ( saving URLS or multer )
