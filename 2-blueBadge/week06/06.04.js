Broken React App Challenge
* 1. Main.js import should be from './components/Main';
* 2. Illegal left side this.state assignment in toggleVillain(); - Should look just like toggleHero() 
* 3. mapData()'s returning JSX is not wrapping on one <div> Surround all JSX in a div
* 4. VillainButton is not being exported
* 5. Main.js's React component import is wrong. Should import either React, { Component }, or change Component, to React.Component for the component declaration
* 6. line 35 has a capital D Data, instead of lowercase
* 7. Sneaky Error, line 40 of Main.js. The .map() requires any number of parameters over one to be wrapped in a parens. Add then around character, index
* 8. HeroButton is not taking in props as a parameter, so they are all undefined.
* 9. Style prop app.js is wrapped in quotes, not { }
* 10. SNEAKIEST Error. What should be Main.js's render() method is written as a ComponentDidMount(). Just replace the names.
* 11. MapData()'s .map() returns should have a key placed on the containing <div>, not the second one
