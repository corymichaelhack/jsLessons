        Talk About Grading and Proffesionalism:
    1. Proffesionalism: 
    This is a job training program, which means youre developing skills to enter into a proffesional field
    Dress like this is high school, which just means no pjs please. Presentation days =  business to business casual. 
    Lateness, try to be on time, we understand traffic can be troublesome in fishers, but if youre 
    late every day, we need to have a conversation. Please dont sleep in class. This is a tough track 
    you will be tired, but try going for a walk, or going to sit out in the open area, or if you dont 
    well please feel free to go home.

    2. Grading: There are a couple of things well be using to tracking your progress. Were going to use Repl and WhiteBoard Challenges
    as a sort of quiz or benchmark to help you keep track of where your weaknesses and strengths are. Well look for completion but they
    wont neccesarily be graded. We will be grading 4 different projects that we will give you over the course of the next three weeks. 
    For those projects well be grading on Proffesionalism, Presentation Flow, Ability to speak to speak about your code confidently 
    effort during work times, and the actual project meeting requirements given .


    Note on Notes and Studying:
      Notes on your machine, will give time to write notes but be quick,
      rewrite notes later, watch videos later,
      this is immersive learning, so youll do best trying something 
      making notes after you write code can help to solidify what youve just done. 
      Also try to find out how you learn best?  Visual(a seer), Auditory(a listener), Kenesthetic(a doer)

     This is a gitbook, this is the main way we will be giving you information outside of lecturing. We are going to go over these fundamentals in class together but if you want to review a subject again, this is your guide.  https://eleven-fifty-academy.gitbook.io/javascript-101-fundamentals

      Lets talk about folder structure: 
      Show them how to view their folders. How to make a new folder (how to open command prompt), (show working 'tree /F' so we can see structure (only for windows machine))  show that folder in vscode. 
      how files work in vscode.
